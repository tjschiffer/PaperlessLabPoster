# PaperlessLabPoster

The Paperless Lab Poster is an interactive web page that recreates a Scientific poster. It was created for "Poster Day" and displayed on a 76" 1920x1080 screen. Participants were able to click into iframe references to applications created as part of the Paperless Lab Initiative.

Applications within iframes have been replaced with static placeholders. An OneNote screenshot that contained proprietary information has been replaced with a placeholder screenshot.
